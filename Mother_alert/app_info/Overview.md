# The idea of the app

Imagine the following senario:
A mother lets her baby sleep peacefully while she is resting or reading some books and wants to keep track of the baby without making any sounds or noises around him or her.
The app idea is based on that senario.


## HOw it works

At first, she must open the responsible camera or just her laptop camera and the app server then closing the app browser tab while the camera and the browser are still working (this setp to enable the link to open on the mother's phone)
For instance, once the baby starts to cry, the app *sends* her an email with a link for a *realtime* watching her baby and also she can take a temporary action if she is busy at that time like playing audio file (e.g Quran or her recorded voice) by controlling the laptop to do so (the laptop controling part is done by the common mobile apps known and it is not a part of that app)




### Note:

the app depends on the same shared network idea but it can also be performed to multi-ones.
The sent email contains the link which is the IP adress of the host device




## Some enhancements can further be done:

*1.* This app is built on mobilenet pretrained model which is not particulary specialized for baby emotion detection.
*2.* Taking action part can be done through an added app feature to do so once the mother click the related button when she is on the server watching her baby.
*3.* By tkinter liberary a GUI can be designed to make it easy for the mother to open the server efortlessly.
